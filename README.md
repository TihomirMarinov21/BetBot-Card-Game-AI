Card Betting Game with AI Bot

This Python-based project simulates a card betting game where an AI bot predicts whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current one. The bot uses simple logic to evaluate the odds and decide how much to bet, adjusting based on its confidence in the outcome. If its balance falls too low or reaches a high point, it will decide to quit the game.

Features:

Bot Decision-Making: The bot compares the current card’s value to others in the deck, choosing whether to bet "higher" or "lower."

Dynamic Betting: The bot adjusts its betting amount based on how confident it is in the outcome.

Quit Logic: The bot will stop playing if its points are too low or high.

Shuffling & Deck Management: The deck is shuffled after a set number of rounds.

Asynchronous Gameplay: Uses asyncio to simulate bot thinking with delays.

This project showcases a basic AI-driven betting strategy in a simple card game format.
